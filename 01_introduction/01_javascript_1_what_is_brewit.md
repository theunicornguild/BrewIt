In this project you will build a website using javascript to make a coffee brewing calculator. The user will be able to choose from a list of brewing methods of their choice. The user will then be able to select the size of the coffee cup theyâ€™ll be brewing and customize their cup of coffee based on their preference by changing the water to coffee ratio. After that the user will view a list of instructions and a timer to start brewing their coffee.
