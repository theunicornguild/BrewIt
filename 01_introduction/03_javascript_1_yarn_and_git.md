### Yarn.

To start creating the project we start off by installing yarn.
Yarn is a package manager and task runner for javascript.

You can install yarn using Homebrew by writing this in the terminal on Mac.

`$ brew install yarn`

### Git.

We’ll be using git throughout this project as a version control tool and to create checkpoints for every feature/functionality we finish.

First you’ll need to fork and clone the project’s repo to have a copy of the repo on your account.

 ⁃	Go to the [project’s git repo](https://github.com/aishabn/BrewIt-Starter.git)
 ⁃	Click `Fork` on the right corner of the page

Once that’s done you’ll need to `Clone` it. On your terminal:

 ⁃	First `cd` into your project’s folder
 ⁃	`Clone` the project

`$ git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/BrewIt-Starter.git`

cd into the project folder and install the packages

`$ cd brewit-starter`
`$ yarn install`

You can run the project and view it on your browser

`$ yarn start`
